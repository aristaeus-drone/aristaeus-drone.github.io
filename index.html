            <h2>The Challenge: A Silent Crisis</h2>
            <p>Pollination is a vital process that supports our planet's ecosystems and food supply. In fact, <strong>75% of flowering plants and 35% of global crops</strong> depend on animal pollinators. However, factors like climate change and pesticide use are causing a dangerous decline in pollinator populations, with nearly 50 species now threatened or endangered. This decline poses a serious risk to global food security and the health of our forests.</p>

            <h2>Our Solution: Aristaeus</h2>
            <p>Aristaeus is a complimentary pollination micro-drone system designed to assist, not replace, the natural pollination process. Our goal is to help sustain biodiversity and promote forest regeneration in areas lacking sufficient animal pollinators. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, we can make a targeted impact where it's needed most.</p>
